a collection of pixel fonts i've made in [YellowAfterlife's pixel font converter](https://yal.cc/r/20/pixelfont/)

with some exceptions, the fonts are recreations of already pre-existing fonts, albeit made to be pixel-perfect or slightly more neater than the original

not sure if that is legal<br>
oh well, i'll find out someday!

feel free and open source to use them :)
