a collection of fonts i've made. pretty much all of them are pixel fonts made with [YellowAfterlife's pixel font converter](https://yal.cc/r/20/pixelfont/).

this repository is a dump for relatively small fonts not worth making a repository for, which will most likely get archived here

with some exceptions, the fonts are recreations of already pre-existing fonts, albeit made to be pixel-perfect or slightly more neater than the original (not sure if that is legal.. oh well, i'll find out someday!!!)

feel free and open source to use them `:)`

## da list of fonts

- [mac's Minecraft](https://github.com/macimas-fonts/macsMinecraft)

- 📂 [Magnolia](./Magnolia)
<br>
pixel font based on the old [Harabara Mais](https://www.dafont.com/harabara-mais-old1.font) font

used to listen to a lot of chiptune music from the YouTube channel [ReclusiveLemming](https://www.youtube.com/@ReclusiveLemming), and i thought the font they used in their vids were pretty cool
