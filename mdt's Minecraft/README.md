a rough 1:1 recreation of Minecraft's main font

download: [.ttf](https://github.com/macimas/fonts/raw/main/mdt's%20Minecraft/mdt's%20Minecraft.ttf), [.otf](https://github.com/macimas/fonts/raw/main/mdt's%20Minecraft/mdt's%20Minecraft.otf)

initially started this back in around December 2022 (possibly even earlier) as a recreation of other Minecraft fonts. they were either not pixel-perfect, outdated, or were quite lacking.

initial attempt only contained Basic Latin and some symbols i needed. was pretty satisfied with it. kept it as is for an entire year, until i revisited the font in December 2023.

was pretty bored in christmas break and thought "wat if i make a mc font that's 1:1 used ingame"

no way in hell i'm gonna be able to do that but tried anyway, making this my most ambitious font recreation yet (wasted 10+ hours in the span of 2 days)

so far, v1.1 has 2,362 symbols, covering [Basic Multilingual Plane](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/plane/U+0000) + some mix of symbols

you may notice that blocks are missing a decent chunk of their symbols, or were skipped entirely. this is because Minecraft's main font does not cover it. if you need to use the font Minecraft uses for fallback, use [Unifont](http://unifoundry.com/unifont/index.html)

i do plan on continuing work on this sometime, like covering more symbols, providing bold and italic variants, and maybe even a thing that tweaks existing symbols and supports symbols not covered by Minecraft's main font

for now,
